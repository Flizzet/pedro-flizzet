        title: 'Ammo Inferno',
        description: 'Ammo Inferno is a 2D pixel art arcade game designed for Android and iOS. Built with Java and LibGDX for cross-platform development and Gimp for pixel art graphics. The project took approximately 5 weeks to complete and distribute. The project has since gained a lot of attention from publishers. However, due to the nature of the project, we\'re not focusing on a full release process. This project functions solely as a representation of our skills, and is downloadable on the Google Play Store. "Uncommonly for a mobile shooter Ammo Inferno has an appreciably large settings menu that gives several different control schemes to choose from and the option to enable/disable individual graphical features. Shoot â€™em up aficionados will get a kick out of this platforming style runner."',

        title: 'Almost a Hero - PA',
        description: 'The Almost A Hero Playable Ad is an interactive advertisement built for the publisher "Tilting Point." Tilting Point wanted to showcase the key gameplay aspects of Almost A Hero, and provide a direct gameplay-based advertisement to the developers. This is only one of the many interactive advertisements I\'ve done with Tilting Point, and has been a hit with publishers & studios alike. The nature of the advertisement brings a new level of engagement for the viewers, and is much more exciting than the boring interstitial. I took advantage of my HTML5 skills, and created everything in vanilla Javascript to ensure compatability with all ad networks. The ad was entirely under 1MB, with no external references. That includes all images and code.',
